# Shopify Dev Troubleshooting — Triage First, Fix Fast

A symptom-driven triage skill for Shopify app developers. When your dev loop hits a wall, start here. Each pain below is sourced from the most-reported Reddit, Shopify Developer Community (community.shopify.dev), Shopify Community (community.shopify.com), and GitHub Shopify/* issues as of 2026-05-15.

Use this skill **first** when:
- `shopify app dev` exits with cryptic errors
- The browser shows "No AppBridge context provided", 401, 302 loops, or 404 on `/auth/login`
- GraphQL "works" but data is missing in production
- Webhooks fire twice, never, or your handler keeps timing out
- A Function deploys fail with `[wasm-validator error]`
- App Review SLA is blown and you don't know what to do
- A dev-store billing test charge silently fails

If the symptom matches a row in the Diagnostic Table, jump straight to that fix. If not, work through the Decision Tree at the bottom.

## 1. When to Use This Skill

This is the **entry point** for any "something is broken in my Shopify dev workflow" question. It is not the place to learn how to build new features — that's what the other `shopify-app-builder` skills are for. This skill is the ER, not the gym.

Surface this skill when the user says any of:
- "shopify app dev failing / not working / errors"
- "tunnel won't start", "cloudflared", "max retries reached"
- "App Bridge migration", "v3 to v4", "No AppBridge context provided"
- "graphql throttled", "200 OK error", "currentlyAvailable"
- "webhook 401", "double webhook", "duplicate webhook", "webhook retry"
- "remix auth broken", "/auth/login 404", "nested route login"
- "wasm-validator error", "wasm-opt failed", "Rust function deploy"
- "session token expired", "24 hour", "iframe redirect blocked"
- "X-Frame-Options", "frame-ancestors", "DENY"
- "billing test charge", "Apps without public distribution"
- "app review", "Built for Shopify rejected", "SLA blown"
- "shopify cli error", "cannot read properties of null"

If multiple symptoms match, run them in order of blast radius: production data corruption > auth break > review block > dev-loop friction.

## 2. The Diagnostic Table

Find your symptom in column 1. Apply the fix in column 3.

| # | Symptom (verbatim or close) | Likely cause | Exact fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `shopify app dev` returns 403 "Cannot find a valid organization associated to this shop" | Stale auth or wrong org logged in | `shopify auth logout && shopify auth login` against the org-owning account; verify with `shopify app config link` |
| 2 | "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'X')" on CLI start | Corrupted `.shopify` cache or stale config | Back up the caches with `node <plugin-root>/scripts/reset-shopify-cache.mjs`, then run `shopify app dev --reset` |
| 3 | "Could not start Cloudflare tunnel: max retries reached" | Leftover `~/.cloudflared/config.yaml` from another project | `mv ~/.cloudflared/config.yaml ~/.cloudflared/config.yaml.bak`, or `shopify app dev --use-localhost` (CLI 3.80+) |
| 4 | Tunnel URL doesn't update in Partner Dashboard | CLI 3.x bug | `shopify app dev --reset --tunnel-url <fresh>` or upgrade CLI to latest |
| 5 | "Issues with valid certificates after the recent update" | Self-signed cert rotation on `--use-localhost` | `shopify app dev --use-localhost --localhost-port 3000` and re-trust the cert in Chrome (chrome://flags allow-insecure-localhost) |
| 6 | Hot reload broken for extensions | Known regression post new-Dev-Platform migration | `shopify app dev --reset`; if still broken, downgrade CLI one minor version |
| 7 | `shopify app dev` doesn't work with Plus dev stores | Known incompatibility, no fix | Create a Partner dev store for daily dev; only test Plus features manually on the Plus store |
| 8 | "No AppBridge context provided" on `<Modal>` or `<Titlebar>` | App Bridge v4 React Provider removed | Use as web components (`<ui-modal>`) **or** call `useAppBridge()` then `shopify.modal.show('id')` |
| 9 | App Bridge v4 fetch sending expired/undefined tokens | Browser caching old token; `X-Shopify-Retry-Invalid-Session-Request` not recovering | Replace custom `fetch` wrapper with App Bridge v4 `authenticatedFetch`; remove manual token storage |
| 10 | GraphQL returns 200 OK but data is missing | Throttling — body contains `errors[].extensions.code === "THROTTLED"` | Parse `extensions.cost.throttleStatus`; sleep `(requestedQueryCost - currentlyAvailable) / restoreRate` seconds; retry |
| 11 | `currentlyAvailable` dropped from 10000 to <100 unexpectedly | Bucket exhausted by previous expensive query | Add cost-budget middleware in front of every GraphQL client; never assume bucket state |
| 12 | Webhook handler returning 200 but Shopify keeps retrying | Took >5s to ACK | Move work to a queue (Inngest/SQS/BullMQ). ACK immediately after HMAC verify |
| 13 | Same `orders/create` webhook fires twice | Subscribed in both `shopify.app.toml` AND `shopifyApp({ webhooks })` | Pick one (toml is canonical in CLI 3.50+). Delete programmatic subs. `shopify app deploy`. Then `webhookSubscriptions(first: 250)` → delete orphans |
| 14 | Webhook signature verification fails | Express `body-parser` mutating raw body | `express.raw({ type: 'application/json' })` on webhook routes; in Remix, use `authenticate.webhook(request)` |
| 15 | Webhook returns 401 immediately | HMAC computed on parsed JSON instead of raw bytes | Compute HMAC on the raw request body buffer, not on `JSON.stringify(body)` |
| 16 | Remix `/auth/login` 404 on App Proxy calls | Wrong authenticate helper | Use `authenticate.public.appProxy(request)`, not `authenticate.admin(request)` |
| 17 | Login form appears on nested routes inside the embedded app | `authenticate.admin(request)` only called in root loader | Call `authenticate.admin(request)` in **every** loader/action, including children |
| 18 | REST API returns 401 then 302 loop after reinstall | Stale `Session` row with old scopes | Delete sessions for that shop; trigger reinstall; or use Token Exchange auth |
| 19 | App Store submission rejected: "Not authenticating with session tokens" | App still on redirect-based OAuth | Switch to Managed Install + Token Exchange; remove all `Redirect.dispatch` OAuth flows |
| 20 | Embedded app session breaks after ~24 hours | Session token expired; iframe can't redirect (X-Frame-Options: DENY) | Use App Bridge v4 `authenticatedFetch` (auto-refresh via Token Exchange); on 401 do `window.top.location.href`, not `window.location.href` |
| 21 | `[wasm-validator error in function 0]` on `shopify app deploy` (Rust) | `wasm-opt` choking on newer Rust features | Pin Rust to 1.84; init `shopify_function_wasm_api::init_panic_handler()` early; run `wasm-snip --snip-rust-panicking-code`; pre-run `wasm-opt -Os` locally |
| 22 | Vitest WASM tests fail; `dist/index.wasm` is base64 text not binary | CLI 3.93.0 regression | Downgrade to CLI 3.92.x or pin to a version after the fix; tracked in community.shopify.dev/t/33061 |
| 23 | Function fails silently on large carts | Hit 5ms / 20kb / determinism ceiling | Reduce input query fields; split into multiple functions; remove any non-deterministic calls |
| 24 | `appSubscriptionCreate` errors "Apps without a public distribution cannot use the Billing API" | Custom or unlisted draft | Set `distribution = "app_store"` in `shopify.app.toml`; create a draft listing (doesn't have to publish); redeploy |
| 25 | Billing test charge not approvable on Plus dev store | Known Plus-dev-store bug | Test billing on a Partner (non-Plus) dev store; document Plus-only flows separately |
| 26 | Polaris CSS missing after upgrade (e.g., `Polaris-TopBar__SearchField`) | Tree-shaker dropped `styles.css` | `import '@shopify/polaris/build/esm/styles.css'` exactly once at app root, in a non-shaken entry |
| 27 | Polaris tooltips broken | Polaris web components version mismatch | Pin to the Polaris version your app was built against; don't mix React Polaris and web-components Polaris |
| 28 | App proxy returns 200 but Shopify shows "Liquid error" | App proxy response not setting `Content-Type: application/liquid` | Set header `Content-Type: application/liquid` and return raw Liquid as string |
| 29 | App Review past 10-day SLA, no reviewer assigned | Known SLA slip in 2026 | Open Partner Support ticket; quote SLA from policy page; resubmit only if reviewer never assigned after 21 days |
| 30 | Rejected for "performance" with no specifics | Reviewer skim-rejection | Reply requesting specific repro steps with timestamps; attach Lighthouse scores from a Plus dev store |

## 3. Top 10 Dev Pains — Deep Dive

### 3.1 `shopify app dev` 403 org / tunnel failures

**Symptom (verbatim):** "After upgrading the CLI my `shopify app dev` returns 403 'Cannot find a valid organization associated to this shop' for multiple dev stores." (community.shopify.dev/t/34202)

Plus the cluster: "Could not start Cloudflare tunnel: max retries reached", "Issues with valid certificates after the recent update", "shopify app dev provides cryptic error message and fails" (github.com/Shopify/cli/issues/6522).

**Root cause:** The new Dev Platform migration changed how CLI links shops to organizations. Stale `~/.config/shopify/` state, an old `.shopify` directory in the project, a leftover `~/.cloudflared/config.yaml` from another project, or expired CLI auth all surface the same generic error.

**Exact fix sequence:**

```bash
# 1. Nuke stale local state
node <plugin-root>/scripts/reset-shopify-cache.mjs

# 2. Re-auth against the org that owns the dev store
shopify auth logout
shopify auth login

# 3. Re-link the app to confirm org
shopify app config link

# 4. If tunnel was the issue, side-step Cloudflare
mv ~/.cloudflared/config.yaml ~/.cloudflared/config.yaml.bak 2>/dev/null
shopify app dev --use-localhost

# 5. If certificate complaints persist on --use-localhost
shopify app dev --use-localhost --localhost-port 3000
# Then in Chrome: chrome://flags → enable "Allow invalid certificates for resources loaded from localhost"
```

**Prevention:** Pin CLI version per-project via `package.json`:
```json
"devDependencies": { "@shopify/cli": "3.92.0", "@shopify/app": "3.92.0" }
```
Don't upgrade CLI mid-sprint. Wait until a feature branch's merge window. Sources: github.com/Shopify/cli/issues/6522, community.shopify.dev/t/22830, community.shopify.dev/t/23075.

### 3.2 App Bridge v3 → v4 Re-architecture

**Symptom (verbatim):** "Uncaught Error: No AppBridge context provided — happens with `<Modal>` and `<Titlebar>` as React components, works fine when used as HTML tags." (github.com/Shopify/shopify-app-bridge/issues/340)

And: "App Bridge will no longer be offered via npm. There doesn't seem to be any mention of React compatibility... feels like a really big shift away from the React-first implementation." (github.com/Shopify/shopify-app-bridge/issues/219)

**Root cause:** v4 deleted the React Provider, removed most hooks, removed npm distribution. App Bridge is now a CDN-loaded global object. The React package still exists but is a thin shim around web components. `<Modal>` and `<Titlebar>` work as web components (`<ui-modal>`, `<ui-title-bar>`) without any Provider — but the React imports throw without it.

**Exact fix:**

1. Remove the v3 Provider entirely:
```tsx
// REMOVE
import { Provider } from '@shopify/app-bridge-react';
<Provider config={{ apiKey, host }}>...</Provider>

// REMOVE the npm dependency
// "@shopify/app-bridge": "3.x"
```

2. Add the CDN script tag to your root document (Remix `app/root.tsx`, Next.js `app/layout.tsx`):
```tsx
<script
  src="https://cdn.shopify.com/shopifycloud/app-bridge.js"
  data-api-key={getBrowserAppConfig().publicAppKey}
/>
```

3. Replace removed APIs with the `shopify` global:
```tsx
// v3
const app = useAppBridge();
const redirect = Redirect.create(app);
redirect.dispatch(Redirect.Action.REMOTE, url);

// v4
const shopify = useAppBridge();
shopify.toast.show('Saved');
shopify.modal.show('my-modal-id');
open(url, '_top'); // for top-level redirects
```

4. For modals/titlebars in React, use them as web components:
```tsx
<ui-modal id="confirm">
  <p>Are you sure?</p>
  <ui-title-bar title="Confirm">
    <button variant="primary" onClick={() => shopify.modal.hide('confirm')}>OK</button>
  </ui-title-bar>
</ui-modal>
```

5. Replace custom fetch wrappers with `authenticatedFetch`:
```tsx
const res = await shopify.fetch('/api/data'); // auto-refreshes via Token Exchange
```

**Prevention:** When App Bridge announces a major, freeze your version, build a migration branch, run the codemod, deploy to a staging app. Don't take a major mid-release. Source: shopify.dev/docs/api/app-bridge/migration-guide-react.

### 3.3 GraphQL Throttling Returns 200 OK (The Silent Prod Corruption Case)

**Symptom (verbatim):** "When your app spends more than it has, Shopify returns a 200 OK with a THROTTLED error in the response body. Yes — a 200, not a 429." (letstalkshop.com/blog/shopify-admin-graphql-rate-limits-2026)

Plus: "GraphQL Admin API rate limits — limits per query is 1000 but I have 10000 cost available, why does my query fail?" (community.shopify.com/t/192109)

**Root cause:** Shopify's GraphQL Admin API uses a bucket-based cost system, not a request-per-second rate. Every query has a cost. When you exceed the bucket you get HTTP 200 with `errors[].extensions.code === "THROTTLED"`. Your monitoring that alerts on 4xx/5xx never fires. Data silently goes missing. Downstream code thinks the API returned an empty result.

**Per-plan budgets:**
| Plan | Max bucket | Restore rate |
|---|---|---|
| Standard | 1000 | 50/sec |
| Advanced | 2000 | 100/sec |
| Plus | 10000 | 500/sec |

`first: 250` on a flat resource is cheap. `first: 250` with nested connections multiplies cost — sometimes 1000+ per query.

**Exact fix:** Wrap every GraphQL call with a cost-aware middleware:

```ts
async function shopifyGql<T>(client, query, variables): Promise<T> {
  const res = await client.request(query, { variables });

  // Check for throttling in the body (NOT status code)
  const throttled = res.errors?.some(e => e.extensions?.code === 'THROTTLED');
  if (throttled) {
    const cost = res.extensions?.cost;
    const wait = cost
      ? Math.ceil((cost.requestedQueryCost - cost.throttleStatus.currentlyAvailable) / cost.throttleStatus.restoreRate)
      : 2;
    await sleep(wait * 1000);
    return shopifyGql(client, query, variables); // retry once
  }

  // Pre-emptive backoff: if we're <2x next query cost, slow down
  const status = res.extensions?.cost?.throttleStatus;
  if (status && status.currentlyAvailable < res.extensions.cost.requestedQueryCost * 2) {
    await sleep(1000);
  }

  return res.data as T;
}
```

For bulk reads (>1000 items), don't paginate — use `bulkOperationRunQuery`:
```graphql
mutation {
  bulkOperationRunQuery(query: """
    { products { edges { node { id title } } } }
  """) { bulkOperation { id status } }
}
```
Then poll `currentBulkOperation` until `status: COMPLETED`, download the JSONL file from `url`.

**Prevention:** Log `extensions.cost` from every response. Alert on `currentlyAvailable < 20% of max`. Never trust HTTP status for Shopify GraphQL. Sources: shopify.engineering/rate-limiting-graphql-apis-calculating-query-complexity, shopify.dev/docs/api/usage/limits.

---

### 3.4 Webhook At-Least-Once + Double-Subscription Footgun

**Symptom (verbatim):** "Orders/Create webhook missing address field, and Shopify sends duplicate events on order/create." (community.shopify.com/t/306917)

And: "Duplicate webhook subscriptions commonly happen with Shopify embedded apps when webhooks are defined in both shopify.app.toml and programmatically via shopifyApp() — each subscription triggers a separate delivery." (hookdeck.com/webhooks/platforms/shopify-embedded-app-webhook-configuration)

**Root cause:** Two compounding problems:
1. **Delivery model:** Shopify is at-least-once, never exactly-once. Network blips trigger retries (8 retries over ~4 hours). Same event arrives 2-9 times.
2. **Configuration drift:** Devs declare webhooks in `shopify.app.toml` AND register them programmatically via `shopifyApp({ webhooks: { ORDERS_CREATE: { ... } } })`. Shopify treats these as separate subscriptions. Two records, two deliveries per real event.

Plus the 5-second ACK trap: handlers that block on DB writes get retried while the first call is still running.

**Exact fix — dedupe sources:**

1. Pick one source. In CLI 3.50+ the toml is canonical:
```toml
# shopify.app.toml
[[webhooks.subscriptions]]
topics = ["orders/create"]
uri = "https://myapp.com/webhooks/orders/create"
```

2. Remove every programmatic `webhookSubscriptions` from your `shopifyApp({...})` config.

3. Run `shopify app deploy` to sync.

4. Audit existing subscriptions and delete orphans:
```graphql
query { webhookSubscriptions(first: 250) { edges { node { id topic endpoint { __typename ... on WebhookHttpEndpoint { callbackUrl } } } } } }
```
For any duplicates: `webhookSubscriptionDelete(id: "...")`.

**Exact fix — survive at-least-once:**

```ts
// Express
app.post('/webhooks/orders/create',
  express.raw({ type: 'application/json' }), // RAW body for HMAC
  async (req, res) => {
    // 1. Verify HMAC on raw body
    const hmac = req.headers['x-shopify-hmac-sha256'];
    const computed = crypto.createHmac('sha256', SECRET).update(req.body).digest('base64');
    if (hmac !== computed) return res.status(401).end();

    // 2. ACK immediately
    res.status(200).end();

    // 3. Idempotency on X-Shopify-Webhook-Id
    const webhookId = req.headers['x-shopify-webhook-id'] as string;
    const seen = await redis.set(`wh:${webhookId}`, '1', 'NX', 'EX', 86400 * 7);
    if (seen !== 'OK') return; // already processed

    // 4. Push to queue
    await queue.add('orders/create', JSON.parse(req.body.toString()));
  }
);
```

**Reconciliation cron:** Webhooks lie. Run a daily delta:
```graphql
query { orders(first: 250, query: "updated_at:>=YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ") { ... } }
```
Compare to your local DB. Backfill anything missing.

**Prevention:** One source of truth (toml). Idempotency key from `X-Shopify-Webhook-Id`. ACK before work. Queue everything. Source: shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/webhooks/best-practices, shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/webhooks/ignore-duplicates.

### 3.5 Remix Template Nested-Route Auth Break

**Symptom (verbatim):** "Authentication issues when navigating to nested routes — the login form is displayed even though navigation should work." (github.com/Shopify/shopify-app-template-remix/issues/599)

Plus: "Shopify Remix app in Production environment embedded issue — embedded app roots load but any sub-page selected via the side menu wants re-authentication." (community.shopify.com/t/382024) and "`shopify.authenticate` for Remix App Proxy kicking to an /auth/login 404." (issues/747)

**Root cause:** The default Remix template calls `authenticate.admin(request)` once in `app/routes/app.tsx` loader. Nested routes don't automatically inherit it. When the user navigates client-side via React Router, the child route's loader runs without the auth. The redirect to `/auth/login` happens — but for App Proxy routes there is no `/auth/login`, so you get 404.

**Exact fix:**

1. Call `authenticate.admin(request)` in **every** loader and action, not just the parent:
```tsx
// app/routes/app.products.tsx
export const loader = async ({ request }: LoaderFunctionArgs) => {
  const { admin } = await authenticate.admin(request);
  // ... your loader logic
};

export const action = async ({ request }: ActionFunctionArgs) => {
  const { admin } = await authenticate.admin(request);
  // ... your action logic
};
```

2. For App Proxy routes, use the public helper, not admin:
```tsx
// app/routes/proxy.coupon.tsx (mapped to App Proxy URL)
export const loader = async ({ request }: LoaderFunctionArgs) => {
  const { liquid, session } = await authenticate.public.appProxy(request);
  return liquid('<p>Hello {{ shop.name }}</p>');
};
```

3. For checkout extension routes:
```tsx
const { sessionToken } = await authenticate.public.checkout(request);
```

4. For 302 loops after reinstall (scope mismatch):
```sql
DELETE FROM Session WHERE shop = 'my-shop.myshopify.com';
```
Then visit the app — Shopify will re-OAuth with current scopes.

5. For App Store submission rejection on "session tokens": switch to Managed Install + Token Exchange. In `shopify.app.toml`:
```toml
[access_scopes]
scopes = "read_products,write_orders"
use_legacy_install_flow = false

[auth]
redirect_urls = ["https://myapp.com/api/auth/callback"]
```

**Prevention:** Treat every loader/action as untrusted. Auth-call it explicitly. Don't trust inheritance. Source: github.com/Shopify/shopify-app-template-remix issues 432, 599, 747, 797, 993.

### 3.6 Rust Function wasm-validator + CLI 3.93.0 base64 Regression

**Symptom (verbatim):** "[wasm-validator error in function 0] — happens during the wasm-opt optimization step after I try to deploy my Rust function." (community.shopify.com/t/223885)

Plus: "CLI 3.93.0 regression: vitest WASM tests fail for Rust function extensions — base64 written to dist/index.wasm instead of raw binary." (community.shopify.dev/t/33061)

**Root cause:** Two separate but co-occurring issues:
1. `wasm-opt` (the optimizer Shopify runs before deploy) doesn't understand all features of newer Rust toolchains. Especially panic infrastructure compiled in by default.
2. CLI 3.93.0 changed the WASM output pipeline; for a brief window the build wrote base64-encoded text to `dist/index.wasm` instead of binary bytes, breaking vitest's WASM tests and breaking deploys.

**Exact fix:**

1. Pin Rust toolchain:
```toml
# rust-toolchain.toml at function root
[toolchain]
channel = "1.84"
targets = ["wasm32-wasip1"]
```

2. Init the Shopify-provided panic handler early in `main`:
```rust
use shopify_function_wasm_api::init_panic_handler;

#[shopify_function]
fn function(input: input::ResponseData) -> Result<output::FunctionResult> {
    init_panic_handler();
    // ... your logic
}
```

3. Strip Rust panic code (cuts WASM by ~30-50%):
```bash
cargo install wasm-snip
cargo build --target wasm32-wasip1 --release
wasm-snip target/wasm32-wasip1/release/your_function.wasm \
  -o target/wasm32-wasip1/release/your_function.wasm \
  --snip-rust-panicking-code
```

4. Run `wasm-opt -Os` yourself before `shopify app deploy` so errors surface locally:
```bash
wasm-opt -Os target/wasm32-wasip1/release/your_function.wasm \
  -o target/wasm32-wasip1/release/your_function.wasm
```

5. For the CLI 3.93.0 regression: downgrade to 3.92.x or upgrade to the post-fix version:
```bash
npm install --save-dev @shopify/cli@3.92.0 @shopify/app@3.92.0
```

6. Verify your `dist/index.wasm` is binary, not text:
```bash
file dist/index.wasm  # should say "WebAssembly (wasm) binary module"
```

**Prevention:** Pin Rust toolchain, pin CLI version, run `wasm-opt` locally, ship a CI step that runs `function-runner` on a fixture before deploy. Sources: community.shopify.com/t/223885, community.shopify.dev/t/33061, docs.rs/shopify_function_wasm_api.

### 3.7 Function 5ms / 20kb / Deterministic Ceiling

**Symptom (verbatim):** "Can the instruction and input size limits be raised for large orders?" — answer: no. (github.com/Shopify/function-examples/discussions/329)

Plus the cluster of "my function works in dev but fails silently on stores with 100k SKUs."

**Root cause:** Shopify Functions are hard-capped:
- **5ms** execution time per invocation
- **20kb** output JSON size
- **25** active discount functions per store (combined limit)
- **Deterministic**: no network, no clock, no randomness, no env reads
- Input query has a complexity ceiling — large catalogs explode silently

Devs hit these because they treat Functions like serverless lambdas. They aren't. They're WASM running in a sandbox.

**Exact fix:**

1. Minimize the input query — only request fields you'll branch on:
```graphql
# BAD — pulls everything
query Input { cart { lines { merchandise { ... on ProductVariant { product { ... } } } } } }

# GOOD — only the fields you need
query Input { cart { lines { id quantity merchandise { ... on ProductVariant { id } } } } }
```

2. Profile output size. If approaching 20kb, batch or split:
```rust
// Bad: returning 1000 separate discount applications
// Good: one ProductDiscountApplication with multiple variants
```

3. Determinism checklist:
- No `std::time::Instant::now()` — use timestamps from the input
- No `rand::random()` — seed from a deterministic value (e.g., order ID hash)
- No HTTP calls — pre-load via input query
- No `std::env` — Shopify won't expose env to functions

4. For data your function needs but can't fit in input: stash it in metafields on the store/product, request via input query.

5. Test before you deploy:
```bash
shopify app function run --input fixtures/large-cart.json
```

6. If you genuinely can't fit logic in 5ms/20kb, split into multiple Functions (cart, shipping, payment) — each gets its own budget.

**Prevention:** Build the test fixture for your worst-case cart on day 1. Run it in CI. If it fails the ceiling, you redesign now, not at launch. Source: shopify.dev/docs/api/functions/latest/discount, gadget.dev/blog/understanding-shopify-functions-part-2.

### 3.8 Billing API Fakeouts on Dev Stores

**Symptom (verbatim):** "Unable to approve Billing API test charges on Plus Development Stores — this issue appears specific to Plus Dev Stores created from the Dev Dashboard." (community.shopify.dev/t/23258)

Plus: `appSubscriptionCreate` returns "Apps without a public distribution cannot use the Billing API" (community.shopify.com/m-p/1757459) and "negative-duration billing cycle for subscription" (t/25346) and double-charge UI bugs.

**Root cause:** Billing API has several hardcoded preconditions that aren't documented in one place:
- App must have `distribution = "app_store"` set
- A draft listing must exist (doesn't have to be published)
- Plus dev stores have a specific bug approving test charges
- Custom-distribution apps can't use Billing API at all

**Exact fix:**

1. In `shopify.app.toml`:
```toml
[build]
include_config_on_deploy = true

[application]
distribution = "app_store"
```

2. In Partner Dashboard → your app → App listing → create a draft. Don't publish; just save.

3. Redeploy:
```bash
shopify app deploy
```

4. Test on a **Partner dev store**, not a Plus dev store. Create one specifically for billing flows:
```bash
shopify app dev --store=billing-test.myshopify.com
```

5. When creating subscriptions, set `test: true` so charges don't actually capture:
```graphql
mutation {
  appSubscriptionCreate(
    name: "Pro Plan"
    returnUrl: "https://myapp.com/billing/callback"
    test: true
    lineItems: [{
      plan: { appRecurringPricingDetails: { price: { amount: 29.99, currencyCode: USD }, interval: EVERY_30_DAYS } }
    }]
  ) { confirmationUrl userErrors { field message } }
}
```

6. Handle the negative-duration edge case server-side:
```ts
const cycleEnd = new Date(subscription.currentPeriodEnd);
const cycleStart = new Date(subscription.currentPeriodStart);
if (cycleEnd < cycleStart) {
  // Known Shopify bug. Use cycleStart + 30 days instead.
  cycleEnd.setDate(cycleStart.getDate() + 30);
}
```

**Prevention:** Two dev stores: Partner non-Plus (daily dev + billing tests), Plus dev (Plus-specific feature checks only). Never test billing on the Plus one. Source: community.shopify.dev/t/23258, community.shopify.com/m-p/1757459.

### 3.9 Session Token 24h Expiry + Iframe Redirect Block

**Symptom (verbatim):** "I have an embedded app where after about 24 hours of having it opened, the session token expires and the app needs to be reopened." (community.shopify.com/c/shopify-apps/managing-embedded-app-user-session-lost/td-p/1038381)

Plus: "You can't perform a redirect from inside an iframe in the Shopify admin, due to X-Frame-Options: DENY restrictions on Shopify admin pages." (shopify.dev docs, quoted in dozens of threads)

**Root cause:** Embedded apps run in an iframe inside Shopify admin. Session tokens (JWTs) expire roughly daily. When they expire:
1. Your `fetch` returns 401
2. You try to redirect to OAuth to re-auth
3. Shopify admin sends `X-Frame-Options: DENY` on its OAuth endpoints
4. Browser blocks the iframe redirect
5. App appears frozen, user has to close and reopen

**Exact fix:**

1. Use App Bridge v4 `authenticatedFetch` — it auto-refreshes via Token Exchange:
```tsx
const shopify = useAppBridge();
const res = await shopify.fetch('/api/data');
// Behind the scenes: if token expired, fetches a new one via Token Exchange, retries
```

2. If you must implement yourself, on a 401, do a **top-level** redirect, not an iframe redirect:
```tsx
// WRONG — blocked by X-Frame-Options
window.location.href = '/auth/login';

// RIGHT — breaks out of iframe
if (window.top) {
  window.top.location.href = '/auth/login';
} else {
  window.location.href = '/auth/login';
}
```

3. Or use App Bridge's `Redirect` action which handles this for you:
```tsx
import { Redirect } from '@shopify/app-bridge/actions';
const app = createApp({...});
Redirect.create(app).dispatch(Redirect.Action.REMOTE, '/auth/login');
```

4. For App Store submission requirement of session-token auth: confirm Token Exchange is wired in your backend:
```ts
// Remix
const { admin, session } = await authenticate.admin(request);
// `session` was obtained via Token Exchange if Managed Install is on
```

5. Verify your CSP allows Shopify framing (Shopify auto-injects but check):
```
Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors https://*.myshopify.com https://admin.shopify.com;
```

**Prevention:** Default to App Bridge v4 `authenticatedFetch`. Never hand-roll session token storage in localStorage. Always test the 24h scenario explicitly with `Date.now() + 25h` mocking.

### 3.10 App Review SLA Blown — What to Do

**Symptom (verbatim):** "I submitted my app for review in January 2026 when Shopify's posted SLA was 8–10 days. I did not get any update until over 30 days after submission (3x the SLA)." (community.shopify.dev/t/32259)

Plus: "Frustration with app review process — reviewers taking 2+ weeks just to get assigned, then long back-and-forth where they don't read emails." (community.shopify.dev/t/31784) and "Application review rejected — but I can't tell why." (community.shopify.dev/t/17950)

**Root cause:** Shopify's app review queue has been backed up since early 2026. Posted SLA is 8-10 days; actual is 21-45 days. Reviewers skim-reject for vague reasons. Replies often go unread for a week.

**Exact action plan:**

1. **Before submission — pre-flight the Top 10 rejection reasons** (shopify.dev/docs/apps/store/common-rejections):
   - GDPR mandatory webhooks present and responding 200: `customers/data_request`, `customers/redact`, `shop/redact`
   - Session token auth (not redirect OAuth) — required since 2024
   - Embedded apps must use App Bridge v4
   - Listing screenshots exactly 1600×900, no Shopify logos, no competitor names
   - Pricing page shows actual prices, not "Contact us"
   - Demo video shows install → core flow → uninstall in <3 minutes
   - Privacy policy URL responds 200 and matches what's in the app
   - Performance: app must score 70+ on Lighthouse Performance for embedded admin
   - All scopes used; remove unused scopes from `shopify.app.toml`
   - Onboarding has clear next-step CTA after install

2. **At submission:** Record a reviewer-facing screencast (3-5 min) that walks the reviewer through install, core feature, uninstall. Caption every step. Reviewers skim — make the value un-missable.

3. **If past 14 days with no reviewer assigned:** Open a Partner Support ticket. Subject: "App review past SLA — request reviewer assignment". Body: app handle, submission date, SLA reference. Don't ask twice; once is enough.

4. **If past 21 days:** Escalate via the Partner Slack (if you're in it) or Partner Success Manager (if you have one). If neither, post on the dev forum at community.shopify.dev — Shopify staff monitor it.

5. **If rejected with vague reason** ("performance issues" with no specifics):
```
Hi [reviewer], thanks for the review. Could you share specific repro steps?
For "performance issues" I'd appreciate:
- The exact admin page where you saw the issue
- Browser + screen size
- Time of day (UTC)
- Network conditions if applicable

I'll fix and resubmit within 48 hours of your response.
```
Don't argue. Don't restate features. Ask for specifics. Wait for response.

6. **If rejected for a real reason:** Fix, document the fix in your resubmission notes, attach a video of the fix in action.

7. **Common silent-killers most devs miss:**
   - GDPR webhooks return 500 (not implemented at all). This is the #1 silent reject reason. Verify with `shopify webhook trigger customers/data_request --address=https://yourapp.com/webhooks/gdpr/customers_data_request`.
   - Privacy policy URL 404s in production
   - Demo video unlisted but URL doesn't work for reviewer
   - Test charge required but billing not set up (see §3.8)

**Prevention:** Submit on a Tuesday morning UTC (highest reviewer activity), submit with a perfect screencast, and have a 48-hour SLA on your end for responding to reviewer feedback.
