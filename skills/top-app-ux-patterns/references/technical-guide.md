# Top App UX Patterns — What the Best-in-Class Shopify Apps Actually Do

A teardown-driven playbook for designing or reviewing Shopify app UX. Built from a live analysis of six top-grossing apps (Klaviyo, Gorgias, Judge.me, Loox, Vitals, PageFly) representing an estimated $70M–$110M of combined Shopify-channel MRR. Use this skill to lift the converged patterns instead of inventing UX from scratch.

---

## 1. When to use

Trigger this skill whenever you are:

- Designing or reviewing a Shopify App Store **listing page** (hero, gallery, description, pricing cards, "Works with")
- Designing the **first-run / install / OAuth → first value** flow
- Designing **empty states** for any in-app screen (dashboard, settings, builder, etc.)
- Designing the **pricing page** or choosing a pricing structure (flat / tiered / slot-based / usage-based)
- Picking the **single addictive metric** for the merchant's dashboard
- Reviewing UX for **install→activate→pay** conversion leaks
- Comparing a competitor's UX against the converged best-practice set
- Auditing copy on the listing or in-app for "outcome vs feature" framing
- Choosing how to handle theme integration (theme code edits vs App Blocks / OS 2.0)
- Deciding what onboarding data to collect at install vs. defer

Do not use this skill for: backend architecture, billing implementation details (use `shopify-app-builder:app-billing`), or scope minimization (use `shopify-app-builder:audit-scopes`). This skill is purely about **what merchants see and feel.**

## 2. The six case studies

Each case study compresses the teardown into the patterns worth stealing. Numbers are estimates from the source teardown dated 2026-05-15.

### 2.1 Klaviyo — Email Marketing & SMS

- **Rating / scale:** 4.6 (2,731 reviews). Est. $35M–$50M MRR from Shopify channel.
- **BFS badge:** No (legacy).
- **Pricing entry:** Free to install. Email from $20/mo (251–500 contacts). SMS from $15/mo.
- **Primary job:** Turn anonymous traffic + one-time buyers into a list to re-monetize across email + SMS + WhatsApp.

**Key takeaways:**

1. Lead the tagline with **outcome + AI**, not feature — "AI marketing… to grow faster" beats "Send emails."
2. **Permanent free tier** (250 contacts forever) is the install hook. Reduces friction to near-zero.
3. **Defer credential friction** — DNS records / sender domain asked only at first send, not install.
4. **Bury complexity behind "See all pricing options"** — three clean cards on the listing, full matrix one click away.
5. The aha moment is the **Abandoned Cart attributed revenue** widget within 72 hours of install.

### 2.2 Gorgias — AI Helpdesk & Chat

- **Rating / scale:** 4.3 (635 reviews — lowest 5-star share in this set). Est. $14M–$20M MRR.
- **BFS badge:** No.
- **Pricing entry:** $10/mo Starter (3 agents, 50 tickets) → $900/mo Advanced. Per-ticket overage.
- **Primary job:** Replace a tangle of inboxes (email + chat + social + voice + SMS) and auto-resolve the repetitive 60% with AI.

**Key takeaways:**

1. **"View demo store"** secondary CTA — uniquely powerful for complex / abstract apps. Lets prospects feel it before installing.
2. **Minimal gallery (2 images)** + bet on the demo + description.
3. **Tiered overage that gets cheaper per unit at higher tiers** is a clean upgrade-pressure mechanic.
4. The aha is the **first AI auto-resolved ticket** with a green "saved ~3 min of agent time" banner.
5. The addictive dashboard metric is **deflection rate.**

### 2.3 Judge.me — Product Reviews

- **Rating / scale:** 5.0 (39,203 reviews — largest absolute review count in this set). Est. $4M–$6M MRR.
- **BFS badge:** Yes — also 2025 Build Award winner.
- **Pricing entry:** **Forever Free** (unlimited reviews, widgets, rich snippets). $15/mo "Awesome" unlocks AI + integrations.
- **Primary job:** Get reviews on the store yesterday without Yotpo prices, with star snippets in Google.

**Key takeaways:**

1. **Stack trust badges visibly** — BFS + Build Award + 5.0 + 39k reviews within the first 200 pixels.
2. **Flat $15 pricing** is a structural moat against per-contact / per-impression competitors.
3. **Win the migration market** — one-click import from CSV, AliExpress, Loox, Yotpo, Stamped, Amazon, Etsy.
4. **Auto-place widgets via OS 2.0 theme blocks** — zero theme editing.
5. Auto-send the first review request 7 days after first fulfilled order. Aha = first photo review live on a product page.

### 2.4 Loox — Visual Product Reviews

- **Rating / scale:** 4.9 (7,854 reviews). Est. $8M–$12M MRR.
- **BFS badge:** Yes.
- **Pricing entry:** Free Beginner (100 emails/mo) → Convert $49.99 → Unlimited $299.99. Order-volume gated.
- **Primary job:** Photo + video reviews for visual product categories (apparel, beauty, decor).

**Key takeaways:**

1. **Longest gallery in this set (8+ slides)** — for visual products, more is more.
2. **Psychology lede** opens the description — "Visual reviews are the strongest form of social proof."
3. **Pick-a-widget empty state** — first action is a low-stakes visual choice with live preview.
4. **Order-volume pricing** aligns billing with merchant success.
5. **Outcome-named tiers** — Beginner / Convert / Unlimited. The tier name is part of the pitch.

### 2.5 Vitals — All-in-One CRO Suite

- **Rating / scale:** 4.9 (2,598 reviews — 97% five-star). Est. $4M–$7M MRR.
- **BFS badge:** Yes.
- **Pricing entry:** Flat $29.99/mo. One plan. 7-day free trial.
- **Primary job:** Replace 10+ apps in a CRO stack with a single $30 bundle.

**Key takeaways:**

1. **Bundling is positioning-as-product** — "replace 10 apps for $30" is the entire pitch.
2. **40+ tile grid empty state** — surface every feature visually, let merchant choose, no forced flow.
3. **Lazy setup beats front-loaded questionnaires** when the value surface is exploratory.
4. **One price, one tier, one decision** — eliminates pricing paralysis.
5. **Visible storefront changes within 5 minutes** drive retention (sticky ATC, trust badges, etc.).

### 2.6 PageFly — Landing Page Builder

- **Rating / scale:** 4.9 (5,703 reviews). Est. $6M–$10M MRR.
- **BFS badge:** Yes.
- **Pricing entry:** Free (1 slot) → Builder $24 → Optimize $39 → Accelerate $99 / $990/yr. Slot-gated.
- **Primary job:** Build conversion-ready landing pages without theme limitations, no code.

**Key takeaways:**

1. **"What do you want to build?" picker empty state** — the single best onboarding flow in this teardown.
2. **Slot-based metering** is the cleanest predictable scaling unit for builder-style apps.
3. **Frame the app as additive, not replacement** — "Go beyond themes" defuses fear of rebuilding the store.
4. **Editor screenshot IS the hero shot** — when the product is a UI, show the UI.
5. **24/7 live chat on every tier including Free** — a moat against bootstrapped competitors.

---

## 3. Convergent patterns — what they all do

These are the patterns that appear in 5 of 6 or 6 of 6 listings. Treat as baseline, not differentiation.

### Hero anatomy (every listing follows this six-line stack)

1. App icon + name
2. Built for Shopify badge (if earned) + award ribbon (if earned)
3. Star rating + review count
4. "Free trial / Free plan / Pricing from $X" label
5. Region trust signal ("Based in United States" — all six)
6. Single primary CTA: **Install** (sometimes paired with "View demo store")

### Gallery anatomy

- **4–11 images, always benefit-named.** Every alt text sells one job. Never "Dashboard view." Always "Collect unlimited reviews automatically from email, SMS, QR code."
- Gallery is the pitch deck. Read more often than the description.
- For visual products: 8+ slides. For utility apps: 4–6.

### Description anatomy

- Two-paragraph block, **duplicated** (visible + after "more"). 5 of 6 apps lean into this Shopify quirk as repetition reinforcement.
- 5 bold capability bullets directly under the gallery — each is a **benefit statement**, not a feature.

### "Works with" curation

- **All 6** list complements; **none** list direct competitors. Klaviyo lists Gorgias. Judge.me and Loox never list each other. Curated trust.

### Pricing presentation

- **Tier-banded with anchoring.** Free → entry paid → mid → premium. Middle tier always carries the visual weight.
- **5 of 6 stack Free Plan + Free Trial** — belt-and-suspenders friction removal.
- Annual discount of **17%** is the App Store norm (Gorgias, PageFly).

### Reviews surface

- Star-distribution **histogram** + Shopify Magic's **"What merchants think"** AI summary. Even with 1-star outliers, the central tendency is the first thing the merchant sees.

### BFS badge leverage

- 4 of 6 (Judge.me, Loox, Vitals, PageFly) display BFS adjacent to the title. Functions as a meta-trust signal that overrides skepticism. Apply for it.

### Single primary CTA

- One Install button. Optional "View demo store" secondary. No competing CTAs, no newsletter signup, no "Learn more" button cluttering the hero.

---

## 4. Differentiators that drive install → activate → pay

What separates the top-1% apps from the merely good. These are the asymmetric bets to consider for a new entrant.

1. **Judge.me's flat $15** in a per-contact / per-impression category. **Pricing model is the differentiator.** If competitors meter usage, go flat. If competitors are flat, go usage-based. Pick the opposite axis.

2. **Vitals' bundle thesis** — "replace 10 apps for $30" is positioning-as-product. The differentiator is the meta-decision, not any individual feature.

3. **PageFly's "what do you want to build?"** picker. No competitor cracks the empty state this cleanly.

4. **Loox's gallery-as-pitch-deck** (8+ slides) for visual products. Most competitors ship 3-image galleries and lose the storytelling battle before the merchant clicks Install.

5. **Klaviyo's permanent free tier** vs. Mailchimp / Omnisend's trials. Merchants can stay free until they scale.

6. **Gorgias' "View demo store"** link. Uniquely useful for complex / abstract apps where screenshots fail to convey value.

7. **BFS badge + Build Award stacked** (Judge.me). A trust signal competitors literally cannot copy without earning the same badges. Plan for both.

8. **24/7 live chat on the Free tier** (PageFly, Loox). A bootstrapped competitor can't afford this — it's a structural moat.

9. **One-click migration from named competitors** (Judge.me, Loox). Switching cost approaches zero.

10. **Outcome-named pricing tiers** (Loox: Beginner / Convert / Unlimited). The tier name sells the merchant's destination at the pricing decision moment.

## 5. Twenty reusable UX patterns

Tagged with example apps + a Polaris / Shopify implementation hint. Steal liberally.

### Listing-page patterns

**1. Stack three trust signals in the hero.**
Examples: Judge.me, Loox, PageFly.
Polaris hint: This is App Store metadata, not Polaris. Plan the BFS application early, drive 100+ five-star reviews in the first 90 days, set up a Build Award submission once you cross 1k installs.

**2. Lead the tagline with the outcome verb.**
Examples: Judge.me ("Sell more"), Loox ("Convert more shoppers"), PageFly ("Go beyond themes").
Polaris hint: Listing copy field. Start with Sell / Convert / Save / Grow / Replace / Automate / Recover. No feature nouns first.

**3. Every gallery image is a job statement.**
Examples: All 6.
Polaris hint: Write the alt text first, design the screenshot second. The alt text is the slide.

**4. Use 6–9 gallery images, not 2–3.**
Examples: Loox (8+), Vitals (9+), Judge.me (6+).
Polaris hint: Budget for a full pitch-deck-in-screenshots during launch — not a minimal gallery. Gorgias' 2-image listing is the exception, not the model, and they offset it with the demo store.

**5. The editor UI is the hero shot for builder-style apps.**
Examples: PageFly.
Polaris hint: If you use AppProvider, embed a real Polaris UI screenshot, not a marketing illustration.

**6. Add "View demo store" alongside Install.**
Examples: Gorgias, Judge.me, Loox, Vitals.
Polaris hint: Spin up a development store with your app pre-installed, populate sample data, link it from the listing. Use Shopify's free dev store program.

**7. Curate "Works with" to feature complements, not competitors.**
Examples: All 6.
Polaris hint: List 6–10 named integrations weighted toward popular complements (Klaviyo, Judge.me, PageFly, Gorgias, Shop App, Meta).

**8. Open the description with a psychology lede.**
Examples: Loox ("Visual reviews are the strongest form of social proof").
Polaris hint: 1–2 sentences reframing the merchant's problem before listing capabilities. Reframe → then features.

**9. Duplicate the description block.**
Examples: 5 of 6.
Polaris hint: This is a Shopify App Store template quirk — lean in. Visible block sells, expanded block reinforces.

### Pricing patterns

**10. Free plan + free trial stacked.**
Examples: Klaviyo, Judge.me, Loox, PageFly.
Polaris hint: Use `appSubscriptionCreate` with `trialDays`. Pair with a feature-gated Free plan that doesn't require billing.

**11. Flat pricing as positioning moat (or usage-based when competitors are flat).**
Examples: Judge.me $15, Vitals $29.99.
Polaris hint: Recurring `appSubscriptionCreate` with a fixed `price.amount`. Avoid `cappedAmount` unless you're going usage-based.

**12. Slot-based metering for predictable scaling.**
Examples: PageFly (1 / 5 / 20 / unlimited slots).
Polaris hint: Meter by a countable, predictable unit ("slots," "stores," "active campaigns") — not abstract API calls or contacts the merchant cannot count in their head.

**13. Outcome-named tiers.**
Examples: Loox (Beginner / Convert / Unlimited).
Polaris hint: Set `name` on each `appSubscription` plan to a destination noun, not "Pro" / "Plus" / "Enterprise."

**14. Bury full pricing matrix behind "See all pricing options."**
Examples: Klaviyo, Loox.
Polaris hint: Show 3–4 clean tier cards on the listing. Link to a deep matrix page on your marketing site for the long tail.

**15. Annual discount = 17%.**
Examples: Gorgias, PageFly.
Polaris hint: Use the App Store norm. `appSubscriptionCreate` with `interval: ANNUAL` priced at 0.83 × (12 × monthly).

### In-app onboarding patterns

**16. Picker-first empty state.**
Examples: PageFly ("What do you want to build?"), Loox (widget picker), Vitals (40-tile grid).
Polaris hint: Polaris `EmptyState` is wrong here. Build a custom card grid (`Layout` + `Card` + `MediaCard` tiles). Never ship a blank canvas as the first screen.

**17. Auto-place widgets via Online Store 2.0 theme blocks.**
Examples: Judge.me, Loox.
Polaris hint: Use Theme App Extensions (`shopify app generate extension --type=theme_app_extension`). Define App Blocks in `blocks/*.liquid`. Skip Asset API and theme code edits entirely — they are the #1 abandon point.

**18. Defer credential friction.**
Examples: Klaviyo (DNS at first send), PageFly (Pixel at first publish).
Polaris hint: At install ask only for Shopify OAuth scopes. Ask for everything else at the exact JIT moment using a Polaris `Banner` with action, or a `Modal` triggered by the relevant CTA.

**19. One-click migration from named competitors.**
Examples: Judge.me, Loox.
Polaris hint: Build a Settings → Import wizard with named tabs per competitor. CSV upload + API import + screenshot-based fallback. List every competitor by name — it converts.

**20. Pick one addictive dashboard metric and show it daily.**
Examples: Gorgias (deflection rate), Klaviyo (attributed revenue), Loox (photo reviews this week).
Polaris hint: Build a hero `Card` with a single big number, a delta vs. last 7 days, and a sparkline. Wire the same metric into a weekly digest email. Pick ONE — not three.

---

## 6. Listing-page patterns (deep dive)

The same teardown reveals consistent listing-page choices worth codifying separately, because the listing converts strangers before they ever see your in-app UX.

### Above-the-fold checklist

- App icon (1024×1024, recognizable at favicon size — most icons fail this)
- App name (≤30 chars; merchants scan)
- BFS badge (apply early)
- Award ribbon (if applicable)
- Star rating + count
- "Free plan available. Free trial available." label
- Single Install CTA
- Optional "View demo store" secondary

### Gallery sequencing rule

Order the slides as the merchant's purchase journey:
1. Connect / setup ("Connect [App] and Shopify in minutes")
2. Core value moment (the screenshot of the product doing its job)
3. Outcome metric / dashboard
4. Differentiator (AI / migration / mobile / speed)
5. Multi-channel reach (Google / Meta / TikTok if applicable)
6. Support / trust / migration
7. (Optional, visual products) lifestyle / before-after

### Description structure

```
[1-2 sentence psychology lede — reframe the problem]

[Capability paragraph — what it does in plain English]

[5 bold benefit bullets, each starting with a verb]

[Optional CTA repeat: "Get started in minutes"]
```

### "Works with" picks

Weight toward popular complements. Always include: Shop App, Checkout, Customer Accounts, Shopify Flow, the dominant ESP (Klaviyo), the dominant reviews app (Judge.me), the dominant page builder (PageFly), the dominant helpdesk (Gorgias) — wherever applicable. Never list direct competitors.

### Pricing card composition

Each card carries:
- Tier name (outcome-noun)
- Monthly price + annual savings
- Included usage unit (slots / contacts / tickets / orders)
- 3–5 included features (benefit-named, not feature-named)
- Trial length on paid tiers
- Single CTA: "Install" or "Start free trial"

### Reviews region

- Histogram + Magic AI summary appear automatically — do not fight Shopify on this.
- Reply to every 1-star review with a fix and a follow-up CTA. The reply is visible to future merchants and converts.

---

## 7. Decision tree: "I'm building X screen"

Use this lookup to jump straight to the right case study.

**I'm building the listing-page hero** → look at **Judge.me**. Stack BFS + Build Award + 5.0 + review count. Tagline starts with "Sell more."

**I'm building the listing-page gallery for a visual product** → look at **Loox**. 8+ slides, each a benefit statement, screenshot is the proof.

**I'm building the listing-page gallery for a utility / multi-feature app** → look at **Vitals**. 9+ slides, each slide is one sub-feature, closing slide is the kill shot ("Replace 10+ other apps").

**I'm building the listing-page gallery for a builder / UI-heavy app** → look at **PageFly**. Lead with the editor screenshot itself. Don't abstract.

**I'm writing the listing description** → look at **Loox** for the psychology lede, **PageFly** for the additive framing.

**I'm building the pricing page (simple flat)** → look at **Vitals** ($29.99 single tier) or **Judge.me** (flat $15 paid).

**I'm building the pricing page (tiered, predictable units)** → look at **PageFly**'s slot-based 1/5/20/unlimited.

**I'm building the pricing page (usage-based)** → look at **Loox** (orders-included) or **Gorgias** (tickets-included with per-unit overage that gets cheaper at higher tiers).

**I'm building the pricing page (named tiers)** → look at **Loox** (Beginner / Convert / Unlimited).

**I'm designing the install / OAuth flow** → look at **Judge.me**. Ask for the minimum at install (sender email + brand color, both pre-filled). Defer everything else.

**I'm designing the first-run empty state for a builder** → look at **PageFly**. "What do you want to build?" picker → 8 tiles → template gallery filtered by choice.

**I'm designing the first-run empty state for a feature-pickable suite** → look at **Vitals**. 40-tile grid with toggles, recommended starter set, no forced linear flow.

**I'm designing the first-run empty state for a widget-driven app** → look at **Loox**. Choose a widget style → live preview on the storefront → approve.

**I'm designing the onboarding checklist** → look at **Klaviyo** (5-step persistent checklist with green checkmarks) or **Gorgias** ("Get started" widget tracking 5 tasks).

**I'm designing the dashboard hero metric** → look at **Gorgias** (deflection rate), **Klaviyo** (attributed revenue), **Loox** (photo reviews this week). Pick ONE number that grows daily.

**I'm designing the migration / import wizard** → look at **Judge.me**. Named tabs per competitor (CSV, AliExpress, Loox, Yotpo, Stamped, Amazon, Etsy). Make switching cost zero.

**I'm designing theme integration** → look at **Judge.me** / **Loox**. Theme App Extensions + App Blocks. Never edit theme code.

**I'm designing a settings page** → look at **Gorgias**. Sectioned by channel (email, chat, social, voice) with a status indicator per channel.

**I'm designing the "first value" moment** → look at the app whose pattern matches your category:
- Re-monetization → Klaviyo (attributed revenue widget within 72h)
- Support → Gorgias (first AI auto-resolved ticket banner)
- Reviews → Judge.me / Loox (first photo review live on a product page)
- CRO suite → Vitals (3 features enabled, visible storefront changes in 5 minutes)
- Pages → PageFly (publish first page, see live URL within 15 minutes)

---

## 8. Anti-patterns observed in top apps

Even category leaders ship friction. Don't copy these.

**1. Hidden scaling curves on the listing.**
Klaviyo's headline price ($20) hides the steep climb for a 10k-contact merchant (~$150/mo). The listing never reveals this. Result: surprise-bill 1-star reviews.
**Don't do this** — surface a representative scaling example on the listing or in the upgrade modal. An honest curve converts better than the bait-and-switch.

**2. Implausibly low entry-tier limits.**
Gorgias' $10 Starter (3 agents, 50 tickets) is a trojan horse. Loox's Free (100 emails/mo) forces upgrade within weeks.
**Don't do this** for the free tier — Judge.me proves a genuinely useful free tier converts better long-term. Entry paid tiers can have caps, but make them realistic.

**3. Opaque add-on pricing.**
Gorgias' "Automation add-on" is the load-bearing AI feature, sold separately on a sales call, with no pricing on the listing.
**Don't do this** — if the feature is the differentiator, price it on the listing. Sales-call pricing leaks merchants to competitors with self-serve pricing.

**4. Vague enterprise asterisks.**
Vitals' "Additional charges apply as your store generates revenue and impact" — no thresholds disclosed.
**Don't do this** — disclose the threshold ("After $X GMV/month, custom pricing applies").

**5. Beta-labeled headline features.**
PageFly's "AI conversion rate optimization (Beta)" is on two tiers. Beta lowers expectations but undercuts the buying argument.
**Don't do this** — either ship the feature or don't sell it on the pricing page.

**6. Crippled free tiers when a real free tier is on-brand.**
Loox's 100 emails/mo Free is so limited it feels punitive next to Judge.me's genuinely useful Free.
**Don't do this** — if you offer Free, make it good enough to retain. The free tier is your acquisition engine, not your upsell trap.

**7. Two-image galleries.**
Gorgias gets away with it because of the demo store. Most apps cannot.
**Don't do this** — ship 6+ slides.

**8. Skipping the region trust signal.**
Apps based outside the US sometimes fail to display a "Based in [country]" line and lose merchants worried about support hours.
**Don't do this** — always surface your region.

**9. Front-loaded questionnaires before any value.**
Forces a merchant to answer 6 questions before seeing the product. Vitals' lazy / on-demand setup beats this.
**Don't do this** — if you need data for personalization, ask only what's needed for the next 60 seconds of value.

**10. Theme code edits as install step.**
Any app that asks the merchant to paste code into theme.liquid loses 30%+ at that step.
**Don't do this** — Theme App Extensions and App Blocks are non-negotiable for any new app in 2026.

---

## Closing principle

The six apps in this teardown represent $70M–$110M of combined Shopify-channel MRR. They share more than they differ because the App Store has converged on a tight set of patterns. The conservative path is to **adopt every converged pattern as baseline** and **place 1–2 differentiator bets** from section 4. Resist the urge to be different on the things merchants don't care about (hero layout, pricing card structure, BFS badge) and concentrate originality on the empty-state moment and the pricing model — the two surfaces where the leaders are still beatable.
