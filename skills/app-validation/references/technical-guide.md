# Version-sensitive technical reference

These examples are retained from v1.x for existing projects. Use the parent SKILL.md workflow first. Read only the section needed; verify API fields, SDK imports, templates, pricing and review requirements against current official documentation before copying code. Examples are not an install script or permission to run mutations. If this reference conflicts with the parent skill or current official documentation, follow the parent skill and official documentation.


## When to Use This Skill

Call this when:
1. **You have an app idea** and need confidence before 4 weeks of build time
2. **You want to avoid false starts** with market validation first
3. **You need to prioritize** which app idea to build if you have multiple
4. **You're mid-build** and getting customer feedback signals

**Do NOT use this if:**
- You've already shipped and have paying customers (use metrics instead)
- You're in execution mode and decided to build (stay focused)

## The 7-Question Pre-Build Validation Framework

Answer all 7 questions with your best estimate. Score each 1-5 (5 = strong yes, 1 = strong no).

### Question 1: Problem Severity (Does it hurt bad enough?)

"On a scale of 1-5, how much pain do merchants have right now?"
- **5:** Merchants spend 5+ hours/week on this; lose money if unsolved; manual workaround fails 50%+ of the time
- **4:** Spend 2-5 hours/week; workaround exists but tedious; minor money loss
- **3:** Spend <2 hours/week; annoying but manageable workaround
- **2:** Nice-to-have improvement; low time cost
- **1:** Merchants don't really complain about this

**Validation method:** Ask 5 merchants "How many hours/week does [problem] cost you?" If 4/5 say >2 hours, you're at 4-5.

**Red flag:** If score <3, problem is aspirational, not acute. Merchants won't pay.

---

### Question 2: Willingness-to-Pay Signal (Will they actually pay?)

"Would a typical merchant in your target market pay $X/month for this?"
- **5:** Multiple merchants have said "Yes, I'd pay $50+/month for this"
- **4:** 3+ merchants said "Maybe $25-30/month" unprompted
- **3:** Merchants said "Maybe I'd try it if free" or "Could work at $10/month"
- **2:** "I'd use it if free but wouldn't pay"
- **1:** "Not worth paying for"

**Validation method:** Ask in interviews: "What's the maximum you'd pay monthly for this? What's minimum to make it worth your time?" If 4/5 say >$15, score 4-5.

**Red flag:** If score <3, problem is real but not monetizable.

---

### Question 3: Retention Plausibility (Will they stick around?)

"If merchants start using this, will they stay for 6+ months?"
- **5:** Solution is sticky by design (required for operations every day)
- **4:** Daily/weekly usage; low switching cost to alternatives
- **3:** Bi-weekly usage; some switching cost
- **2:** Monthly usage; high switching cost (easy to stop)
- **1:** One-time use; merchants will abandon after task completes

**Validation method:** Ask: "Once you solve this problem, will you need to keep using it weekly?" If yes, score 4-5. If it's a one-time setup, score 1-2.

**Red flag:** If score <3, churn will be >30%/month, killing unit economics.

---

### Question 4: Build Complexity vs Founder Skill (Can you actually ship?)

"How complex is this to build relative to your experience?"
- **5:** You've built 3+ similar apps; <4 weeks for MVP
- **4:** Similar to past projects; 4-6 weeks with learning
- **3:** Requires 1-2 new technologies; 6-8 weeks
- **2:** Requires deep learning in unfamiliar domain; 8-12 weeks
- **1:** Requires ML/distributed systems/real-time data processing; >12 weeks

**Validation method:** Sketch MVP: "What are the 3 core features?" If all are API-integration or dashboard, score 4-5. If you need to learn new framework, score 3. If it requires ML, score 1-2.

**Red flag:** If score <3 and you're solo, you won't finish in 90 days. Adjust scope or team up.

---

### Question 5: Distribution Path (How will they find you?)

"Do you have a distribution channel to reach 100+ merchants in 90 days?"
- **5:** Existing audience (email list 500+, Twitter 2k+ followers, partnership ready)
- **4:** Can reach niche community easily (Facebook group, subreddit, forums with active presence)
- **3:** Can cold-email 50+ prospects per week; willing to do manual outreach
- **2:** App Store search only; no warm channel
- **1:** No plan to reach customers; hoping App Store ranking appears

**Validation method:** List 5 specific ways you'll reach first 100 customers. If 3+ are warm (email, partnerships, existing audience), score 4-5. If all cold, score 2-3.

**Red flag:** If score <3, you'll take 6+ months to hit $1k MRR. Okay if you have runway, risky if bootstrapping.

---

### Question 6: Defensibility (Will competitors copy you?)

"How easy is this for a competitor to replicate in 3 months?"
- **5:** Network effects, data moat, or exclusive partnership (hard to copy)
- **4:** Requires specific domain expertise or customer relationships
- **3:** Process/product differentiation; smart execution wins
- **2:** Copyable but slower (competitor could match in 4-6 months)
- **1:** Trivially copyable; first-mover advantage only lasts 2-3 months

**Validation method:** Could Shopify build this natively? Could Klaviyo or Recharge add it as a feature? If yes, score 1-2. If requires specialized knowledge, score 4-5.

**Red flag:** If score <2 and you're bootstrapping, be prepared to sell or partner before a big competitor enters.

---

### Question 7: Gross Margin Math (Does the unit economics work?)

"Will you make money on each customer, accounting for payment processing, support, hosting?"
- **5:** Pricing >$50/month; COGS <20%; unit margins 70%+
- **4:** Pricing $25-50/month; COGS 20-30%; unit margins 50-70%
- **3:** Pricing $10-25/month; COGS 30-40%; unit margins 40-50%
- **2:** Pricing <$10/month or COGS >40%; unit margins <40%
- **1:** Pricing <$5/month or will require heavy support; unprofitable

**Validation method:**
- Payment processing: 3.5% (Stripe)
- Hosting/database: Estimate per customer
- Support: $1-5/month per customer
- Margins = (Price - COGS) / Price
- Rule: If <40% margin, you need 10k+ customers to be sustainable. Risky.

**Red flag:** If score <3, you're building a lifestyle business (not a venture). Know what you're signing up for.

## The 5-Merchant Interview Protocol

### Interview Script (20 minutes)

**Intro (2 min):**
"Hi [Name]. Thanks for 20 minutes. I'm researching how [niche] merchants solve [problem]. I'm not selling anything—just learning. Honest feedback helps me most."

**Problem Understanding (5 min):**
1. "How do you currently solve [problem]?"
2. "What's frustrating about your current approach?" (Listen for pain signals)
3. "How much time do you spend on this per week?"

**Willingness-to-Pay (5 min):**
4. "If an app solved this, how much would you pay monthly?" (Don't anchor; let them answer)
5. "What features would it need to be worth that price?" (Listen for must-haves)

**Retention Signal (4 min):**
6. "Would you need this app indefinitely, or is it one-time?" (Score retention here)
7. "Would you switch from [current solution] if this was 50% cheaper?" (Switching costs)

**Outro (4 min):**
8. "Can I send you a waitlist link in 2 weeks? I'll give early customers 50% off first year." (Pre-sale signal)
9. "Who else should I talk to in your niche?" (Warm intros > cold email)

### Interview Scoring Rubric

| Signal | Strong (5) | Moderate (3) | Weak (1) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Problem severity | Spends 5+ hrs/week; lost money | 2-4 hrs/week | <1 hr/week |
| Current solution fit | "It's broken, I hate it" | "Works but tedious" | "I'm fine with it" |
| Willingness-to-pay | "I'd pay $50/month" | "Maybe $20-25" | "Only if free" |
| Stated features needed | 2-3 specific, detailed | 1-2 generic features | Vague answers |
| Retention likelihood | "I'd need this forever" | "Maybe 6-12 months" | "One-time fix" |
| Switching cost | "Pain to change now" | "Could switch if easy" | "No switching cost" |
| Pre-sale signal | "Yes, send waitlist" | "Maybe, depends on price" | "Not interested" |

**Scoring:** Sum scores for all interviews. Target: 28+/35 (80%+) to proceed with build.

## Landing Page + Waitlist Test

### The Template (Webflow, no-code, <1 day to build)

```
# Headline: [Problem Result] in [Timeframe]

[Subheading: Benefit statement]

## The Problem
[2-3 sentences: How merchants currently lose money/time]

## The Solution
[Your app name]: [What it does]

### What You Get:
- Feature 1: [What it does + benefit]
- Feature 2: [What it does + benefit]
- Feature 3: [What it does + benefit]

## FAQ

**Q: How long does onboarding take?**
A: <5 minutes. Install, connect, start.

**Q: Can I try it free?**
A: Yes. [30-day free trial] with full features.

**Q: What if I don't like it?**
A: Cancel anytime. No questions asked.

## Join the Waitlist
Early access: 50% lifetime discount + priority support
[Email input + "Notify Me" CTA]

Launching: [Date 4 weeks from now]
```

### Waitlist Test Success Metrics

- **Goal:** 100 signups in 30 days (indicates strong demand)
- **Minimum:** 50 signups (problem is real, but demand is moderate)
- **Red flag:** <25 signups (either problem is unknown or niche is tiny)

### How to Drive Traffic (Organic)

1. **Reddit r/shopify** (2-3 posts per week)
   - Share specific problem you're solving
   - Never hard-sell; let conversation emerge
   - Goal: 5-10 signups per post

2. **Shopify Community Forums** (1-2 relevant thread responses)
   - Add to existing threads about the problem
   - Link to waitlist only if on-topic
   - Goal: 3-5 signups per thread

3. **Twitter** (Daily, if you're active)
   - Share merchant pain points
   - Ask for feedback on solution direction
   - Link to waitlist in bio
   - Goal: 2-3 signups per day if you have audience

4. **Cold email** (Optional, high-touch)
   - 20 relevant store owners per week
   - Subject: "Question for you: [problem]?"
   - Goal: 10-20% reply rate, 5-10% signup rate

### Conversion Math
- 500 landing page visits → 50 signups = 10% conversion (strong)
- 500 visits → 25 signups = 5% conversion (okay)
- 500 visits → <10 signups = 2% conversion (rethink value prop)

---

## Pre-Sale Test (Highest Confidence Signal)

**Email to waitlist after 2 weeks:**

Subject: "50% lifetime discount ends soon [Your App Name]"

Body:
"We're launching [App Name] in 2 weeks. I'm offering the first 50 waitlist members 50% off forever as a thank you.

[Problem]: [2-sentence description]
[Solution]: [2-sentence description]

Pricing: $29/month ($14.50 with this offer)
[Link to pre-order/purchase]

No refunds needed—we'll set up your trial first."

### Pre-Sale Scoring
- **5+** customers commit = Demand is confirmed. Build it.
- **2-4** customers commit = Demand is moderate. Adjust positioning or pricing.
- **0-1** customers commit = Problem doesn't justify price. Kill idea or pivot.

## MVP Scope Definition (4-Week Target)

### Cut Ruthlessly

**REMOVE from MVP:**
- Multi-language support
- Admin dashboard analytics
- Webhooks to 5+ platforms
- Advanced permission systems
- Mobile app (web-responsive okay)
- Email notifications (basic only)
- API documentation
- Custom integrations

**KEEP for MVP:**
- Core workflow: 1 painful step, fully solved
- Core integrations: 1-2 essential APIs only
- Authentication: Shopify OAuth only
- Database: Simple schema, no complex queries
- UX: Functional, not beautiful
- Support: Email only

### Example MVP Scope: Dropshipping Order Reconciliation

**What to build:**
1. Dashboard showing all orders from connected supplier APIs (3 integrations: AliExpress, Shopee, Supplier 1)
2. Order status sync (manual refresh + 12-hour auto-sync)
3. Tracking number capture + auto-update to Shopify
4. Export orders as CSV

**What NOT to build:**
- Margin calculator
- Supplier rating system
- Batch order management
- Real-time webhooks
- Mobile app
- Advanced analytics

**Realistic 4-week timeline:**
- Week 1: Shopify OAuth + database schema + UI layout
- Week 2: AliExpress API integration
- Week 3: Status sync + tracking capture
- Week 4: Testing + Shopify review submission

## Kill Criteria: When to Abandon

**Stop if ANY of these are true:**

1. **Interview Score <20/35**
   - Fewer than 3/5 merchants willing to pay at target price
   - Action: Pivot to different problem or niche

2. **Waitlist Score <25 signups in 30 days**
   - Insufficient demand signal
   - Action: Either rethink marketing or kill idea

3. **Pre-Sale Score 0 commits in 2 weeks**
   - Merchants won't pre-pay even with discount
   - Action: Abandon or find different angle

4. **Build complexity >8 weeks solo**
   - You can't ship in 90-day window
   - Action: Simplify MVP or team up

5. **Gross margins <35%**
   - Unit economics don't work at any reasonable scale
   - Action: Raise prices or cut COGS; if neither possible, kill

6. **5+ competitors all with 4.5+ ratings**
   - Market is won; differentiation is nearly impossible
   - Action: Move to different niche

7. **Shopify is shipping this feature natively in Q2/Q3**
   - You will be undercut before profitability
   - Action: Kill and find different problem

8. **Churn will likely be >15%/month**
   - Problem is nice-to-have, not must-have
   - Action: Find stickier problem

## Prioritization Matrix (If You Have Multiple Ideas)

Score each idea 1-5 on each axis. Plot on matrix.

```
                High Defensibility

     |        Build only  |   Build   |
     |        if funded   |   first   |
     |                    |           |

     |_____________________|___________|
               [Build Complexity / Niche Size]
```

**Placement logic:**
- **High demand + Low build complexity + High defensibility** = BUILD FIRST
- **High demand + Low complexity + Low defensibility** = BUILD FAST (before copied)
- **High demand + High complexity + Low margins** = SKIP (unit economics fail)
- **Low demand** = KILL (waste of time)

## 7-Question Framework Scores

| Question | Score (1-5) | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Problem severity | [X] | [Quote from interviews / time spent] |
| Willingness-to-pay | [X] | [Price points mentioned] |
| Retention likelihood | [X] | [Usage frequency signal] |
| Build complexity vs skill | [X] | [Time estimate + experience] |
| Distribution path | [X] | [5 specific acquisition channels] |
| Defensibility | [X] | [Competitive advantage / moat] |
| Gross margin math | [X] | [Price - COGS calc] |
| **TOTAL SCORE** | **[X]/35** | **[% of max]** |

## Interview Summary
- **Merchants interviewed:** [Names/types]
- **Interview score:** [X/35]
- **Key pain signal:** [Most common complaint]
- **Willingness-to-pay:** $[Min]-$[Max]/month (median: $X)
- **Pre-sale commitment:** [X customers] at [Price]

## MVP Scope & Timeline
- **Core workflow:** [One sentence]
- **Essential integrations:** [1-2 APIs]
- **Realistic timeline:** [Weeks]
- **Build complexity vs your skill:** [Match/Gap]

## Recommendation

**[BUILD / PIVOT / KILL]**

**Reasoning:**
- [If BUILD] This scores [X/35]. Problem is acute ($[money]/week loss), merchants will pay $[price], and you can ship in 4 weeks. Proceed with MVP.
- [If PIVOT] Problem severity is low, but willingness-to-pay for angle [X] is stronger. Suggest pivoting to [alternative angle].
- [If KILL] [Reason: interview score / waitlist performance / build complexity / margin math / competition]. Recommend moving to idea [Next priority].
```

## Decision Tree: Should You Build This App?

```
START: You have an app idea
  ↓
Step 1: Run 5-question interviews with target merchants
  Result: Interview score [X/35]

  [Score >24] → Continue
  [Score 15-24] → Consider pivoting problem angle
  [Score <15] → KILL, move to next idea

  ↓
Step 2: Launch landing page + waitlist
  Result: [X signups in 30 days]

  [>50 signups] → Continue
  [25-50 signups] → Proceed but expect slower traction
  [<25 signups] → Rethink positioning or kill

  ↓
Step 3: Run pre-sale test
  Result: [X customers pre-commit]

  [>2 pre-sales] → BUILD
  [0-1 pre-sales] → Either kill or pivot pricing/positioning

  ↓
Step 4: Validate MVP scope & timeline
  Can you ship in 4 weeks? Build complexity vs skill match?

  [YES] → BEGIN BUILD
  [NO] → Simplify MVP or add co-founder
```

## Key Metrics Throughout Validation

- **Interview conversion:** (Willing to pay) / 5 merchants = demand %
- **Willingness-to-pay median:** Ask 5 merchants, find median price point
- **Waitlist conversion:** Signups / traffic = demand signal
- **Pre-sale conversion:** Pre-commits / waitlist = monetization confidence
- **Build time estimate:** Weeks to MVP (target: <4 weeks)
- **Churn prediction:** Daily/weekly/monthly usage = monthly retention rate
- **Gross margin:** (Price - COGS) / Price (target: >40%)

---

## Validation Timeline

**Week 1:** Recruit 5 merchants + run interviews
**Week 2:** Build landing page + start driving waitlist traffic
**Week 3:** Analyze waitlist conversion; if >50, launch pre-sale
**Week 4:** Decision: BUILD, PIVOT, or KILL

**Total validation time:** 4 weeks (before writing one line of code)

If validation passes all gates, you enter MVP build phase with 90+ days of runway.
